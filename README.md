# emby_to_vudu_on_roku
This repo will enable emby to track which vudu movies you own.

This repo is not ready for use yet.

When this project is complete you will be able to track all of your vudu movies in emby
If you are using a roku, selecting play on a movie within emby will launch the roku app directly to the movie.

Requirements will be:
1. Python 2.7.5+
2. requests module for python
3. webserver of choice
4. Chrome Web Browser
5. This plugin for Chrome:

6. Emby Media server webhook plugin
7. Roku streaming device if you want to have emby launch you to the movie within Roku
8. Emby media server running on a flavor of Linux.  (This is being developed on CentOS 7)

I hope to have future releases no longer need the Chrome requirement, but I want to have a working release for everyone first.
